              As a condition to using certain features of the Service (including, without limitation, the free download feature, or making a purchase from Company or an Artist), you may be required to provide certain personal information to Company or relevant Artists, such as your e-mail address, country of residence and zip/postal code.
                <br><br>
              Following an Artist or purchasing a subscription to an Artist (an “Artist Subscription”) gives that Artist access to your email address, as does making a purchase from an Artist while logged in to your Account.

                    You may browse the Site and view Content without registering, but as a condition to using certain aspects of the Service, you may be required to register with Company and select a password and screen name (“User ID”). You shall provide Company with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Company account. You shall not (i) select or use as a User ID or domain a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a User ID or domain a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a User ID or domain a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.

                    You may purchase products and/or services from an Artist through the Site, including, without limitation, purchases of Content (including digital Content made available via download and streaming through the Service (“Digital Content”)) and physical merchandise (“Merchandise”). Each such purchase is a “Transaction.”
                    <br><br>
                    All inquiries regarding Transactions involving Merchandise only (a “Merchandise Transaction”) will be directed to the relevant Artist. Company is not responsible for refunds for Merchandise, except as provided in this Agreement.
                    <br><br>
                    All sales of Digital Content are final (except where prohibited by law), unless otherwise determined by WaveCut. If you do not receive the Digital Content or otherwise have an issue with the Digital Content delivered, please contact WaveCut with your request and proof of payment, and we will notify the relevant Artist and work with them to resolve your issue. At WaveCut’s sole discretion, you may be credited or refunded for the Digital Content. However, you understand and agree that WaveCut is a platform that Artists use to sell their products, and the Digital Content is derived from files provided by the relevant Artist, and the relevant Artist is solely responsible for such files.
                    Your total price for Digital Content will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is based on your location and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you purchase the product. We will charge tax only in states or countries where digital goods are taxable.
                    <br><br>
                    Content you purchase in a Transaction cannot be guaranteed to be available to you perpetually. For example, if we receive a notification of claimed infringement from a copyright owner or its agent with respect to specific Content, then U.S. law may require us to remove that Content from the Service and not make it available for future sale and we may also have to deny continued access to anyone who previously purchased such Content. This means that you may lose access to purchased Content previously available to you through the Service.
                    <br><br>
                    If we are required by law to deny access through the Service to previously purchased Content, including by removing access to Content from a user’s personal collection through any mobile application, then Company and Artists will not provide the user who purchased that Content with a refund, except as required by applicable law. Users bear all risk from the denial of access to any Content purchased through the Service.
                    <br><br>
                    Because there is a possibility that we may be required to deny you access to previously purchased Content, we encourage you to promptly download any Content you purchase through the Site to your own devices so that you will retain control and possession of such Content even if we are required to remove the Content from the Service.
                    <br><br>
                    You warrant that if you enter into a Transaction, then you shall be able to make full and immediate payment for the requested products or services.

                    You will set the prices for your products and services that are charged through Transactions (the “Prices”) through the Site, and you may change the Prices at your sole discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, WaveCut may redistribute previously purchased copies of your products to users who have, in WaveCut’s sole determination, received a corrupted copy of your product, an incorrect file format version of your product, an incomplete copy of your product, or suffered a loss of your product through hard drive failure, damage, theft or destruction, on a no-fee basis to the user (i.e., the user is not charged a new fee for the redistribution). Such redistribution may be effectuated by allowing a user to redownload a replacement copy themselves. In the event of any of the foregoing redistributions, no additional payments shall be made to you for such redistributions.
                    <br><br>
                    You shall be solely responsible and liable for, and Company shall have no responsibility or liability for, any Stripe fees (except for fees charged on Company’s Stripe account), PayPal fees (except for fees charged on Company’s PayPal account), credit card transaction fees (together, “Fees”), bad debts (such as credit card returns or fraud), disputed payments, and refunds, except as provided in this Agreement.
                    <br><br>
                    WaveCut may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by WaveCut to you pursuant to this Agreement as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation. WaveCut shall remit any such withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority.
                    For Merchandise Transactions, payments received from users for Merchandise shall be directed to you, unless there is an outstanding Revenue Share owed to Company in which case such payments may be directed to Company in accordance with Company’s standard policies. WaveCut may retain funds otherwise payable to you if WaveCut is required or chooses to provide a refund on your behalf.
                    <br><br>
                    For Digital Content, WaveCut will collect the purchase price and any applicable Fees and taxes. WaveCut will pay you the gross proceeds we receive from the sale of Digital Content, minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable Fees (the “Artist Payout”).
                    For Artist Subscriptions, payments received from users shall be directed to you (the “Subscription Fee”), minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable fees which shall be directed to WaveCut at the time of each payment.
                    <br><br>
                    When you receive a payment for Digital Content or Artist Subscription, you are liable to WaveCut for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any Fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment sent by the sender, plus the applicable Fees if there is a chargeback, a dispute, or if there is a reversal of the payment. You agree to allow WaveCut to recover any amounts due to WaveCut by debiting your account or withholding any Artist Payout or Subscription Fee. If there are insufficient funds to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse WaveCut through other means.
                    <br><br>
                    Company retains the right, but does not have the obligation, to immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services, prevent or restrict access to the Site or the Services or take any other action in case of technical problems, objectionable material, inaccurate listings, or actions otherwise prohibited by the procedures and guidelines contained on the Site, or for any other reason in the sole and absolute discretion of Company, and to correct any inaccurate listing or technical problems on the Site. Company may immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services upon receipt of notifications of claimed infringement, upon acquiring knowledge of actual infringement, or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing material is apparent with respect to any goods or services.

                    <br>
                    that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Company will terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the service.
                    <br><br>   
                    C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:
                    If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the owner of the intellectual property, the owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:
                    <br><br>
                    A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;
                    <br>
                    Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access to has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
                    <br>
                    A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and
                    <br>
                    Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
                    <br>
                    If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.
                    <br><br>
